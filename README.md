## Feed.Me
A browser-extension to customise (social media) feeds client-side.

### Motivation
Go onto your social media of choice (facebook, instagram, linkedin etc.) and look at the first post. Why do you think that post is at the top? Is it personalised for you? Did you want to see it or not? How about the next one?

Increasingly the applications we use in our day-to-day lives are driven by algorithms that are hard to understand and are optimised for the end-goals of the developers (e.g. advertising money, time-on-site) and not for the users (e.g. keeping in touch with family, finding a new job). Feed.me is an experiment to see what happens when we give users more control over the algorithms that control their feeds. Can we allow a grandparent to look at photos of their kids without being shown political news, or allow a trauma victim to filter for things that are specifically triggering for them, or allow an electrician who was recently made redundant to use their feed to find leads on new jobs rather than waste more time that they could be using to continue pursuing their online degree? 

Technically all these things are well within reach, but they don't always align well within the current business models of the service providers. Feed.me hopes to leverage the power of the browser (using browser-extensions) to put the user in control with easy to understand “plug and play” algorithms that will work on all their social media. 

### Development
Developement of the browser extension is done at `browser-extension/`

A generic social media app used for testing can be found at `generic-feed-app/`

Everything is currently javascript (server and client) but it's possible that the server-side will be changed to python depending on different contributors wishes.

More contributing guidelines will be added in the future but anyone is welcome to help. Please open an issue if you are interested :)
